        <h1>About me and achievements</h1>
        <p>
          For the first time, I saw painted flowers on the walls of a clay house
          in my grandmother's village in Petrykivka, Dnipropetrovsk region when
          I was 10 years old. Bright flowers, birds and amazing plots captured
          my childhood imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ukrainian tradition of painting the walls of a peasant's house
          existed as early as 300 years ago. Many generations of nugget masters
          from Petrykyvka carefully passed down their skills from grandmother to
          granddaughter, preserving the traditions and sacred meanings of the
          patterns. No one in my family drew. But my father always supported my
          creativity. So, thanks to him, I became more familiar with the special
          Ukrainian ethnic painting.
        </p>

          The Druzhba factory worked in the village of Petrikivka for 40 years,
          so my father sent me to study with the famous artist Fyodor Panko. And
          it was in the workshops of the factory that I saw an unusual way of
          painting berries and flowers with my fingers. The brushes were also
          homemade from cat fur and were called "kittyka". At the factory,
          painters painted bright wooden caskets, plates, spoons, chests, etc.
          in huge batches. Therefore, almost every Ukrainian person has an idea
          about the Petrykiv painting. I was lucky to see all technological
          processes and learn to distinguish Ukrainian painting from others
          thanks to the technique and symbolism that I learned in childhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Already at a mature age, I remembered the ability to draw Petrykiv
          painting. Over time, I created a creative studio "Zernyatko" in Lviv.
          And my goal became to reproduce the flowering of Petrykivka that I
          once saw in my childhood. And now, for 12 years, my mission has been
          to master and popularize the Petrykiv painting. I teach children and
          adults and continue to study myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I use finger painting as art therapy. And drawing small elements
          with a "cat" in order to master Ukrainian ethnic calligraphy. All this
          well develops fine motor skills in children and forms creative
          thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          To date, I have many exhibitions in Ukraine and 16 personal
          exhibitions abroad. Namely in Poland, Spain, France and Turkey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, I work as an art psychologist in Lviv and abroad. Currently, I
          am working on my 2 manuals about Petrikovsky painting. In addition,
          several methods with the basics of painting and psychological
          influence on the development of children's motor skills are being
          refined. The manuals are intended for the work of teachers and
          psychologists with painting as art therapy. But for people who want to
          master Petrykiv painting without a teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
          For almost 350 years of the existence of folk wall painting, the
          Petrykiv painting has turned into an art that has been recognized as
          an intangible heritage of "UNESCO". The symbolism and skill of artists
          is enriched. But the tools and techniques of painting still remain
          primitive, which distinguishes Petrykiv painting from other types of
          applied art.
